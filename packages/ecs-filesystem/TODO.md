# ECS Filesystem Package TODO

## Overview  
Bevy ECS-based filesystem operations with path validation, directory watching, and cross-platform support.

## Core Requirements

### Resources
- [ ] `FileSystemManager` - Central filesystem coordinator  
- [ ] `FileSystemConfig` - Allowed paths, security policies
- [ ] `DirectoryWatcher` - File system change notifications
- [ ] `FileOperationQueue` - Batch operation management

### Events
- [ ] `FileReadRequested` - Request to read file contents
- [ ] `FileWriteRequested` - Request to write file contents
- [ ] `DirectoryListRequested` - Request directory contents
- [ ] `DirectoryWatchRequested` - Start watching directory for changes
- [ ] `FilePermissionRequested` - Check file access permissions
- [ ] `FileReadCompleted` - File read results
- [ ] `FileWriteCompleted` - File write confirmation  
- [ ] `DirectoryChanged` - File system change notifications
- [ ] `FileOperationFailed` - File operation errors

### Components
- [ ] `FileOperation` - Track ongoing file operations
- [ ] `DirectoryWatchTask` - Active directory monitoring
- [ ] `FileValidationTask` - Path security validation

### Systems
- [ ] `process_file_reads_system` - Handle file read requests
- [ ] `process_file_writes_system` - Handle file write requests
- [ ] `process_directory_operations_system` - Handle directory operations
- [ ] `directory_watching_system` - Monitor filesystem changes
- [ ] `file_validation_system` - Validate paths and permissions
- [ ] `batch_file_operations_system` - Optimize bulk file operations

## File Operations to Support
- [ ] **Plugin Discovery** - Scan for plugin manifests
- [ ] **Asset Management** - Icons, configs, templates  
- [ ] **Log File Management** - Rotation, archival, cleanup
- [ ] **Export/Import** - User data and configurations
- [ ] **Temporary Files** - Secure temp file handling
- [ ] **Backup Operations** - File system backup coordination

## Advanced Features
- [ ] Cross-platform path normalization
- [ ] Secure temporary file creation and cleanup
- [ ] File operation batching for performance
- [ ] Directory tree synchronization
- [ ] File content streaming for large files
- [ ] Atomic file operations (write-then-rename)
- [ ] File compression and decompression

## Security Requirements
- [ ] Path traversal attack prevention (../ protection)
- [ ] Whitelist-based directory access control  
- [ ] File permission validation before operations
- [ ] Symlink attack prevention
- [ ] Maximum file size limits
- [ ] File type validation and restrictions
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive file operations

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] Async file I/O doesn't block ECS systems
- [ ] Efficient directory tree traversal
- [ ] File operation batching to reduce syscalls
- [ ] Memory-mapped file reading for large files
- [ ] Directory watch debouncing for rapid changes
- [ ] File operation caching where appropriate

## Platform Support
- [ ] **macOS** - FSEvents integration, app bundle handling
- [ ] **Linux** - inotify integration, XDG directory standards
- [ ] **Windows** - ReadDirectoryChangesW, Windows paths
- [ ] Unified API across all platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations

## Integration Points  
- [ ] Plugin discovery (scan for plugin files)
- [ ] Configuration management (read/write configs)
- [ ] Asset pipeline (manage UI assets)
- [ ] Logging system (log file rotation)
- [ ] Backup system (file-based backups)

## Dependencies
- [ ] `bevy` - ECS framework
- [ ] `notify` - Cross-platform file system watching
- [ ] `tokio` - Async file operations  
- [ ] `serde` - Config file serialization
- [ ] `tracing` - Operation logging
- [ ] `uuid` - Unique file operation IDs
