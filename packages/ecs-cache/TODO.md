# ECS Cache Package TODO

## Overview
Bevy ECS-based in-memory caching service with TTL, LRU eviction, and cache warming capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Resources
- [ ] `CacheManager` - Central cache coordinator with multiple cache instances
- [ ] `CacheConfig` - Configuration for TTL, max size, eviction policies
- [ ] `CacheMetrics` - Performance tracking and hit/miss ratios

### Events
- [ ] `CacheReadRequested` - Request to read from cache
- [ ] `CacheWriteRequested` - Request to write/update cache entry  
- [ ] `CacheInvalidateRequested` - Request to remove cache entry
- [ ] `CacheReadCompleted` - Cache read result (hit/miss)
- [ ] `CacheWriteCompleted` - Cache write confirmation
- [ ] `CacheEvictionOccurred` - Notification of cache eviction

### Components
- [ ] `CacheOperation` - Track ongoing cache operations
- [ ] `CacheWarmupTask` - Background cache warming operations

### Systems
- [ ] `process_cache_reads_system` - Handle read requests
- [ ] `process_cache_writes_system` - Handle write requests  
- [ ] `process_cache_invalidations_system` - Handle invalidation requests
- [ ] `cache_eviction_system` - LRU/TTL-based eviction
- [ ] `cache_warming_system` - Proactive cache population
- [ ] `cache_metrics_system` - Collect and report cache statistics

## Cache Types to Support
- [ ] **Plugin Metadata Cache** - Plugin manifests, capabilities
- [ ] **Search Results Cache** - Recently searched queries and results  
- [ ] **Icon/Asset Cache** - UI icons, images, fonts
- [ ] **Configuration Cache** - Plugin configs, user settings
- [ ] **API Response Cache** - External API call results

## Advanced Features  
- [ ] Cache partitioning by plugin/service
- [ ] Distributed cache invalidation events
- [ ] Cache warming on startup
- [ ] Memory pressure-based eviction
- [ ] Persistent cache storage (optional)
- [ ] Cache compression for large entries
- [ ] Read-through and write-through patterns

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] Sub-millisecond cache reads for hot entries
- [ ] Async cache operations don't block ECS systems
- [ ] Configurable memory limits per cache partition
- [ ] Efficient bulk cache operations
- [ ] Lock-free reads where possible

## Integration Points
- [ ] Plugin discovery system (cache plugin metadata)
- [ ] Search aggregator (cache search results)
- [ ] UI system (cache rendered assets)
- [ ] Service bridge (cache cross-plugin communications)

## Dependencies
- [ ] `bevy` - ECS framework
- [ ] `moka` - High-performance cache implementation
- [ ] `serde` - Serialization for cache values
- [ ] `tokio` - Async operations
- [ ] `tracing` - Instrumentation
