## Final Tasks
- [x] Run cargo check to verify 0 errors and 0 warnings - **ACHIEVED: 0 errors, 0 warnings**
- [ ] Test functionality as end user
- [ ] Final QA review

## Success Summary
✅ **OBJECTIVE COMPLETED**: Fixed all 19 compilation warnings
- Started with: 0 errors, 19 warnings  
- Ended with: **0 errors, 0 warnings**

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Unused imports**: Removed unused RenderLayers and HashSet imports
2. **Unreachable patterns**: Fixed exhaustive match patterns in cursor.rs
3. **Unused variables**: Prefixed unused parameters with underscore where appropriate
4. **Visibility issues**: Made internal structs public to match public function signatures
5. **Function pointer comparisons**: Implemented custom PartialEq for all state structs and TextAnimator, excluding function pointers from equality comparison

### Quality Standards Met:
- ✅ Production-quality code (no stubs or placeholders)
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained
- ✅ Intentional design decisions documented with comments
- ✅ Zero compilation errors and warnings achieved
