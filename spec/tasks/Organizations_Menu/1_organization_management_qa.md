# Task 1: Organization Management Core System QA Validation

## Overview
Comprehensive QA validation suite for the organization management core system. All test modules are properly decomposed into logical files under 300 lines each with clear separation of concerns.

## Test Implementation Example

### Core Integration Test Pattern
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod organization_tests {
    use super::*;
    use bevy::app::App;

    #[test]
    fn test_organization_creation_workflow() {
        let mut app = setup_test_app();
        
        let org_name = "Test Organization".to_string();
        let settings = OrganizationSettings::default();
        
        app.world_mut().send_event(OrganizationEvent::CreateOrganization {
            name: org_name.clone(),
            initial_settings: settings,
        });
        
        app.update();
        
        let registry = app.world().resource::<OrganizationRegistry>();
        assert_eq!(registry.organizations.len(), 1);
        
        let org = registry.organizations.values().next().unwrap();
        assert_eq!(org.name, org_name);
        assert_eq!(org.member_count, 1);
    }

    fn setup_test_app() -> App {
        let mut app = App::new();
        app.add_plugins(OrganizationPlugin);
        app.insert_state(OrganizationState::Ready);
        app
    }
}
```

### Performance Validation Pattern
```rust
#[test]
fn test_organization_switching_performance() {
    let mut app = setup_test_app();
    let org_ids = create_multiple_test_organizations(&mut app, 100);
    
    let mut switch_times = Vec::new();
    
    for org_id in &org_ids[0..10] {
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        
        app.world_mut().send_event(OrganizationEvent::SwitchOrganization {
            org_id: org_id.clone(),
        });
        app.update();
        
        switch_times.push(start_time.elapsed());
    }
    
    let avg_time = switch_times.iter().sum::<Duration>() / switch_times.len() as u32;
    assert!(avg_time < Duration::from_millis(200));
}
```

### Security Validation Pattern
```rust
#[test]
fn test_role_based_access_enforcement() {
    let mut app = setup_test_app();
    
    let test_cases = vec![
        (OrganizationRole::Owner, Permission::ManageOrganization, true),
        (OrganizationRole::Admin, Permission::ManageOrganization, false),
        (OrganizationRole::Member, Permission::ViewMembers, true),
        (OrganizationRole::Guest, Permission::ViewMembers, false),
    ];
    
    for (role, permission, should_have_access) in test_cases {
        let permissions = get_role_permissions(&role);
        let has_permission = permissions.contains(&permission);
        assert_eq!(has_permission, should_have_access);
    }
}
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development Testing
```bash
# Run all organization tests
cargo nextest run organization

# Run specific test categories
cargo nextest run organization::integration
cargo nextest run organization::performance --release
cargo nextest run organization::security
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
cargo llvm-cov nextest --lcov --output-path coverage.lcov

# Performance regression testing
cargo nextest run organization::performance --release --profile ci

# Security validation
cargo nextest run organization::security --profile security
```

### Test Data Management
- **Isolated Test Database**: Each test runs with clean state
- **Mock External APIs**: No external dependencies in tests  
- **Deterministic Test Data**: Reproducible test scenarios
- **Performance Baselines**: Regression detection thresholds

Each test file maintains strict <300 line limits with focused responsibilities and comprehensive validation coverage following Bevy testing best practices.
