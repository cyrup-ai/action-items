# Task 3: QA Button Group Validation

## Objective
Validate the interactive button group system including layout consistency, external integration functionality, modal behavior, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Validation Criteria

### Button Layout and Styling Verification
- **Horizontal Alignment**: Verify three buttons are evenly spaced and centered
- **Consistent Sizing**: Confirm all buttons maintain 140x36px dimensions
- **Gap Consistency**: Validate 16px spacing between adjacent buttons
- **Visual States**: Test hover, active, and default button appearance

### External Integration Testing
- **Browser Opening**: Verify "Visit Website" opens correct URL in default browser
- **Email Client**: Test "Send Feedback" opens email client with pre-filled subject
- **Cross-Platform**: Validate functionality on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Error Handling**: Test graceful fallback when browser/email unavailable

### Acknowledgements Modal Validation
- **Modal Display**: Verify modal opens with proper backdrop overlay
- **Content Scrolling**: Test scrollable acknowledgements list functionality
- **Modal Dismissal**: Validate modal closes on backdrop click or escape key
- **Content Accuracy**: Confirm acknowledgements list includes all dependencies

### Interaction State Management
- **Click Response**: Verify immediate visual feedback on button activation
- **Hover Effects**: Test smooth color transitions on mouse hover
- **Focus States**: Validate keyboard focus indicators and navigation
- **Loading States**: Test visual feedback during external operation initiation

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify tab order flows logically through all buttons
- **Screen Reader**: Test button labels are announced correctly
- **Focus Indicators**: Confirm high contrast focus rings for all buttons
- **Modal Accessibility**: Validate modal traps focus and announces content

## Testing Framework

### Functional Integration Tests
- External URL opening verification across platforms
- Email client integration with different default clients
- Modal state management and content loading
- Error handling for failed external operations

### Visual Regression Tests
- Button group layout consistency at different window sizes
- Hover and focus state visual validation
- Modal appearance and backdrop overlay accuracy
- Button styling consistency with theme system

### Cross-Platform Validation
- macOS: Test `open` command integration for URLs and mailto
- Windows: Verify `cmd /C start` functionality
- Linux: Test `xdg-open` integration and fallbacks
- Error logging and user notification accuracy

### Performance Testing
- Modal opening/closing animation performance
- External operation response time validation
- Memory usage during acknowledgements display
- UI responsiveness during async operations

## Success Metrics
- All three buttons function correctly with proper external integration
- Modal displays and dismisses smoothly with proper focus management
- Cross-platform compatibility verified for URL and email opening
- All accessibility requirements met with keyboard and screen reader support
- Error handling provides clear user feedback for failed operations
