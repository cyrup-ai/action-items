# Global Hotkey Config - QA Validation for Theme Management System

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the theme management system implementation and verify compliance with all specified constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Core System Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in theme management systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in theme management systems
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling for theme loading failures
- [ ] Validate zero-allocation theme switching implementation
- [ ] Check blazing-fast performance for live theme changes

#### Bevy Integration Compliance
- [ ] Verify asset_loading.rs patterns correctly implemented for theme resources
- [ ] Confirm hot_asset_reloading.rs patterns used for live theme updates
- [ ] Check ui/ui.rs patterns followed for UI component updates
- [ ] Validate ecs/event.rs patterns implemented for theme events

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/systems/theme_management.rs` implements theme switching (lines 1-134)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/platform/system_appearance.rs` implements OS integration (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/systems/custom_themes.rs` implements custom theme support (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/components/theme_selector.rs` implements UI components (lines 1-78)
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/resources/theme_assets.rs` implements asset management (lines 1-45)

#### System Integration Testing
- [ ] Test automatic theme switching based on macOS Dark Mode changes
- [ ] Verify Windows/Linux system theme change detection
- [ ] Confirm integration with ui/src/ui/theme.rs existing system (lines 23-89)
- [ ] Test integration with ui/src/ui/components.rs color updates (lines 156-234)
- [ ] Validate "Follow system appearance" preference functionality

#### Theme Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test live theme switching without application restart
- [ ] Verify theme dropdown shows correct preview
- [ ] Confirm "Open Theme Studio" button launches Theme Studio
- [ ] Test custom theme file validation and loading
- [ ] Verify fallback to default theme on custom theme failures

#### Performance Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify < 200ms for complete theme switch
- [ ] Confirm theme asset preloading doesn't impact startup time
- [ ] Test memory usage remains stable during theme switching
- [ ] Verify hot reloading works without performance degradation
- [ ] Confirm theme asset garbage collection prevents memory leaks

#### Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Test graceful handling of corrupted theme files
- [ ] Verify clear user feedback for theme loading failures
- [ ] Confirm system appearance detection failure handling
- [ ] Test recovery from invalid custom theme configurations
- [ ] Validate proper asset cleanup on theme switching failures

#### UI Component Integration
- [ ] Test all UI components correctly update colors during theme switch
- [ ] Verify theme selector dropdown shows current selection accurately
- [ ] Confirm theme preview updates in real-time during selection
- [ ] Test theme system checkbox state persistence
- [ ] Validate consistent color application across all interface elements

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass before proceeding to window mode system implementation. Focus on seamless theme transitions and robust system integration.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
