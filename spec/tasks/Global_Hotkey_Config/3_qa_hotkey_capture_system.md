# Global Hotkey Config - QA Validation for Hotkey Capture System

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the hotkey capture system implementation and verify compliance with all specified constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Core System Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in hotkey recording systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in hotkey recording systems
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling for system API failures
- [ ] Validate zero-allocation key combination processing
- [ ] Check blazing-fast performance for real-time key capture

#### Bevy Integration Compliance
- [ ] Verify `Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>` correctly used following keyboard_input.rs patterns (lines 12-23)
- [ ] Confirm modifier detection follows keyboard_modifiers.rs patterns (lines 12-17)
- [ ] Check modal interaction follows button.rs state management patterns (lines 24-45)
- [ ] Validate event system integration follows ecs/event.rs patterns

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/systems/hotkey_recording.rs` implements recording system correctly (lines 1-156)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/systems/recording_modal.rs` implements modal interface (lines 1-89)  
- [ ] Check `ui/src/systems/hotkey_conflicts.rs` implements conflict detection (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/platform/hotkey_registration.rs` implements OS integration (lines 1-134)

#### Functional Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test real-time key combination capture with all modifier keys (⌘, ⌥, ⌃, ⇧)
- [ ] Verify modal displays captured keys as "⌘ Space", "⌃ ⌥ L" format
- [ ] Confirm automatic modal dismissal on successful capture
- [ ] Test Escape key cancellation functionality
- [ ] Validate conflict detection with system shortcuts

#### System Integration Testing
- [ ] Test global hotkey registration on target platforms (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup on registration failures
- [ ] Confirm integration with app/src/window/ focus management
- [ ] Test integration with core/src/events.rs event system (lines 45-67)
- [ ] Validate integration with ui/src/ui/systems.rs modal rendering

#### Performance and Security Testing
- [ ] Verify < 10ms latency for key registration detection
- [ ] Confirm < 50ms visual feedback for recording display updates  
- [ ] Test memory usage remains constant during extended recording sessions
- [ ] Verify no sensitive key combinations logged or stored
- [ ] Confirm proper permission handling for system-level access

#### Error Handling Validation
- [ ] Test graceful handling of hotkey registration failures
- [ ] Verify clear user feedback for permission denial scenarios
- [ ] Confirm fallback behavior when system shortcuts conflict
- [ ] Test recovery from corrupted hotkey configuration
- [ ] Validate proper cleanup on application termination

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass before proceeding to theme management system implementation. Focus on production-quality OS integration and zero-latency key capture performance.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
