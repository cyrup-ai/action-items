# Global Hotkey Config - QA Validation for System Integration

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the system integration implementation and verify compliance with all specified constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Core System Integration Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in system integration code
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in system integration code  
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling with `Result<T, SystemIntegrationError>` types
- [ ] Validate safe system API integration with privilege management
- [ ] Check graceful degradation when system features unavailable

#### Platform Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/platform/startup_integration.rs` implements startup management (lines 1-134)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/platform/menu_bar.rs` implements menu bar control (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/platform/hotkey_platform.rs` implements hotkey registration (lines 1-123)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/platform/appearance_monitor.rs` implements appearance detection (lines 1-78)
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/platform/service_manager.rs` implements service management (lines 1-67)

#### Platform-Specific Testing
- [ ] Test macOS LaunchServices integration for startup management
- [ ] Verify Windows startup registry management works correctly
- [ ] Confirm Linux autostart desktop entry creation and removal
- [ ] Test macOS NSStatusBar integration for menu bar control
- [ ] Verify cross-platform global hotkey registration and cleanup

#### System API Integration Testing
- [ ] Test macOS Carbon/Cocoa hotkey registration with proper cleanup
- [ ] Verify Windows RegisterHotKey API integration and error handling
- [ ] Confirm Linux X11/Wayland hotkey support functions correctly
- [ ] Test macOS NSAppearance change notification handling
- [ ] Verify Windows theme change registry monitoring

#### Error Handling and Recovery Testing
- [ ] Test graceful handling of permission denial scenarios
- [ ] Verify clear user feedback for system API unavailability
- [ ] Confirm proper recovery from registration failures
- [ ] Test automatic service recovery and health monitoring
- [ ] Validate proper resource cleanup on application termination

#### Security and Permission Testing
- [ ] Verify minimal privilege requirements are enforced
- [ ] Test proper handling of system permission requests
- [ ] Confirm secure storage of system integration state
- [ ] Validate audit logging for system-level operations
- [ ] Test permission validation before system API calls

#### Integration Point Testing
- [ ] Test integration with core/src/ application state management
- [ ] Verify integration with app/src/ application lifecycle
- [ ] Confirm event bus integration for system change notifications
- [ ] Test settings persistence for system integration preferences
- [ ] Validate real-time system change event processing

#### Performance and Resource Testing
- [ ] Verify system integration doesn't impact application startup time
- [ ] Test resource usage remains minimal during system monitoring
- [ ] Confirm proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
- [ ] Validate background service efficiency and low CPU usage
- [ ] Test memory usage stability during extended system monitoring

#### Platform Abstraction Testing  
- [ ] Test SystemIntegration trait provides consistent interface across platforms
- [ ] Verify error types are properly abstracted and user-friendly
- [ ] Confirm platform-specific code isolated in appropriate modules
- [ ] Test graceful fallbacks when platform features unavailable
- [ ] Validate consistent behavior across macOS, Windows, and Linux

#### System Integration Features Testing
- [ ] Test "Launch at login" checkbox correctly manages startup registration
- [ ] Verify "Show in menu bar" checkbox controls menu bar visibility
- [ ] Confirm global hotkey registration updates system-wide shortcuts
- [ ] Test system appearance changes trigger automatic theme updates
- [ ] Validate all system integrations persist across application restarts

#### Bevy Example Integration Verification
- [ ] Verify return_after_run.rs patterns correctly implemented for system services
- [ ] Confirm asset_loading.rs patterns used for resource lifecycle management
- [ ] Check async_compute.rs patterns implemented for async error handling
- [ ] Validate ecs/event.rs patterns used for system event integration

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass for production deployment. Focus on robust cross-platform system integration with comprehensive error handling and security compliance.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
