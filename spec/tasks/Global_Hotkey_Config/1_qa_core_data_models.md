# Global Hotkey Config - QA Validation for Core Data Models

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the core data models implementation requirements and verify compliance with all specified constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` anywhere in src/* code
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in src/* code  
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling with `Result<T, E>` types
- [ ] Validate zero-allocation patterns are implemented
- [ ] Check blazing-fast performance considerations

#### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Confirm all structs implement required traits (Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize, Reflect)
- [ ] Validate Bevy `Resource` trait implementation for global access
- [ ] Verify atomic state updates with Bevy's change detection
- [ ] Check integration with existing `core/src/` persistence system
- [ ] Validate integration with `app/src/preferences/` module

#### File Structure Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/settings/global_config/mod.rs` exists and is properly structured
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/settings/global_config/hotkey.rs` implements GlobalHotkeyConfig correctly (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/settings/global_config/theme.rs` implements ThemeConfig properly (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/settings/global_config/window_mode.rs` implements WindowModeConfig (lines 1-45)
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/settings/global_config/recording_modal.rs` implements HotkeyRecordingModal (lines 1-56)

#### Bevy Example Integration
- [ ] Verify keyboard_modifiers.rs patterns correctly implemented for modifier key detection
- [ ] Confirm asset_loading.rs patterns used for theme resource management
- [ ] Check button.rs interaction patterns implemented for modal components
- [ ] Validate reflection.rs patterns used for settings serialization

#### Data Structure Validation
- [ ] Verify KeyCombination struct includes all required fields (modifiers, key, display_string, system_representation)
- [ ] Confirm conflict detection data structures are complete and functional
- [ ] Validate system appearance monitoring structures are properly integrated
- [ ] Check preview generation system data structures are comprehensive

#### Integration Point Testing
- [ ] Test integration with core/src/lib.rs settings persistence (lines 156-189)
- [ ] Verify seamless integration with app/src/preferences/ module
- [ ] Confirm system API integration points are properly abstracted
- [ ] Validate event system integration for real-time updates

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass before proceeding to hotkey capture system implementation. Any failures require immediate remediation of the core data models.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
