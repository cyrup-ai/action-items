# Main Menu - QA Validation for Core Launcher Data Models

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the core launcher data models implementation and verify compliance with all constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in launcher data systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in launcher data systems
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling with `Result<T, E>` types
- [ ] Validate zero-allocation patterns for action item handling
- [ ] Check blazing-fast performance for search operations

#### Data Structure Implementation
- [ ] Confirm `ActionItem` component implements all required fields (id, title, description, icon, source, command_tag, action_type, metadata)
- [ ] Validate `SearchState` resource includes query, results, selected_index, is_ai_mode fields
- [ ] Check HashMap<String, String> metadata uses efficient string storage
- [ ] Verify component derives Debug, Clone traits appropriately
- [ ] Confirm proper Bevy component registration

#### File Structure Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/launcher/mod.rs` exists and properly exports modules
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/launcher/action_item.rs` implements ActionItem component (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/launcher/search_state.rs` implements SearchState resource (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/launcher/favorites.rs` implements favorites system (lines 1-78)
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/launcher/ai_integration.rs` implements AI integration (lines 1-56)

#### Bevy Integration Compliance
- [ ] Verify ecs/component.rs patterns correctly implemented for ActionItem
- [ ] Confirm ecs/system_param.rs patterns used for SearchState resource
- [ ] Check ecs/event.rs patterns implemented for launcher events
- [ ] Validate efficient querying patterns following system_param examples

#### Integration Point Testing
- [ ] Test integration with core/src/plugins/ action discovery (lines 45-123)
- [ ] Verify integration with core/src/search/ search system (lines 23-89)
- [ ] Confirm integration with core/src/runtime/ Deno runtime (lines 67-134)
- [ ] Test integration with app/src/events/ event system

#### Multi-Source Action Support
- [ ] Verify support for Search Snippets with red icon integration
- [ ] Confirm Kill Process with yellow/orange icon support
- [ ] Test Create Quicklink with red/pink icon functionality
- [ ] Validate Search Crates with golden icon integration
- [ ] Check Webpage to Markdown with teal icon support
- [ ] Test Things Integration with blue checkbox icons

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Verify search operations complete in < 50ms
- [ ] Test memory usage remains constant during search operations
- [ ] Confirm zero-allocation string handling for metadata
- [ ] Validate efficient favorites list updates
- [ ] Test AI integration doesn't impact search performance

#### AI Integration Validation
- [ ] Test context-aware AI query processing with search context
- [ ] Verify natural language command generation functionality
- [ ] Confirm integration with existing Deno runtime system
- [ ] Test AI-powered automatic favorites based on usage patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass before proceeding to search and filtering system implementation. Focus on blazing-fast search performance and seamless multi-source integration.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
