# Main Menu - AI Assistant Integration System

## Task: Implement AI Assistant with Context-Aware Query Processing

### File: `ui/src/systems/ai_assistant.rs` (new file)

Create comprehensive AI assistant integration with natural language processing, context preservation, and intelligent suggestions.

### Implementation Requirements

#### Context-Aware AI System
- File: `ui/src/systems/ai_assistant.rs` (new file, line 1-145)
- Implement `ai_assistant_system` with current search context preservation
- Integration with existing AI configuration from AI_Menu specifications
- Natural language query understanding with intent recognition
- Bevy Example Reference: [`async_tasks/async_compute.rs`](../../../docs/bevy/examples/async_tasks/async_compute.rs) - Asynchronous AI processing patterns

#### AI Query Processing Pipeline
- File: `ui/src/ai/query_processor.rs` (new file, line 1-123)
- Natural language to action command translation
- Context extraction from current search state and selected items
- Integration with existing Deno runtime AI operations
- Intelligent command generation based on user patterns and available actions

#### Suggestion System Integration
```rust
pub fn ai_suggestion_system(
    search_state: Res<SearchState>,
    ai_config: Res<AIConfig>,
    mut suggestion_events: EventWriter<AISuggestionEvent>,
    action_query: Query<&ActionItem>,
) {
    // Implementation for contextual AI suggestions
}
```

#### AI Response Integration
- File: `ui/src/systems/ai_response_handler.rs` (new file, line 1-89)
- AI response processing and action generation
- Integration with launcher action execution system
- Contextual response display with inline suggestions
- Smart action recommendations based on AI analysis

#### Conversation Context Management
- File: `ui/src/ai/context_manager.rs` (new file, line 1-67)
- Maintain conversation context across launcher sessions
- Context-sensitive follow-up question handling
- Integration with AI Chat system from AI_Menu for extended conversations
- Privacy-conscious context storage with user control

### Architecture Notes
- Event-driven AI integration with AIEvent for decoupled processing
- Asynchronous AI processing to maintain UI responsiveness
- Context preservation across search state changes and action selections
- Integration with existing AI provider system and API key management
- Secure AI query processing with input validation and sanitization

### Integration Points
- `core/src/runtime/` - Deno runtime AI operations integration (lines 89-167)
- `ui/src/settings/ai_config/` - AI configuration from AI_Menu integration
- `app/src/events/` - AI event handling coordination with launcher events
- `core/src/plugins/` - Plugin-based AI action generation and execution

### AI Provider Integration
- File: `ui/src/ai/provider_bridge.rs` (new file, line 1-78)
- Integration with configured AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Intelligent provider selection based on query type and context
- Fallback handling for provider failures or API limit scenarios
- Cost-conscious request routing and optimization

### Event System Integration
```rust
#[derive(Event)]
pub enum AIEvent {
    QuerySubmitted(String, SearchContext),
    ResponseReceived(String, Vec<ActionSuggestion>),
    SuggestionAccepted(ActionSuggestion),
    ContextUpdated(SearchContext),
    ConversationRequested,
}
```

#### Smart Action Generation
- File: `ui/src/ai/action_generator.rs` (new file, line 1-95)
- AI-powered custom action creation based on natural language
- Dynamic plugin discovery for AI-generated action capabilities
- Validation and sandboxing of AI-generated commands
- User confirmation workflow for generated actions

#### Performance Optimization
- File: `ui/src/ai/performance_optimizer.rs` (new file, line 1-56)
- Request batching and caching for common AI queries
- Predictive context preparation for faster response times
- Background context processing during user interaction
- Memory-efficient conversation context management
