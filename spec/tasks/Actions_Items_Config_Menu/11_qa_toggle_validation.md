# Task 11: QA Enable/Disable Toggle System Validation

## Objective
Validate the enable/disable toggle system including iOS-style toggle switches, dependency management, bulk operations, animation smoothness, and state persistence.

## Validation Criteria

### Toggle Switch Interface
- **Visual Design**: Verify iOS-style toggles with proper dimensions (44x24px)
- **Color States**: Test blue background for enabled, gray for disabled states
- **Knob Animation**: Confirm smooth knob movement during state transitions
- **Border Indication**: Validate red borders appear for restricted toggles

### State Management Validation
- **Individual Toggles**: Test single extension/command enable/disable functionality
- **State Persistence**: Verify toggle states persist across application restarts
- **Real-time Updates**: Confirm toggle changes reflect immediately in all interfaces
- **Undo/Redo**: Test ability to revert toggle state changes

### Dependency System Testing
- **Parent-Child Dependencies**: Verify disabling parent extension disables child commands
- **Required Dependencies**: Test commands cannot be enabled without required dependencies
- **Dependency Warnings**: Confirm warnings appear before disabling items with dependents
- **Conflict Detection**: Validate conflicting extensions cannot be enabled simultaneously

### Bulk Toggle Operations
- **Multi-Selection**: Test bulk enable/disable operations on selected items
- **Progress Feedback**: Verify bulk operations show progress and completion status
- **Partial Success**: Test handling when some items cannot be toggled in bulk operation
- **Performance**: Confirm bulk operations complete efficiently with large selections

### Animation and Visual Feedback
- **Toggle Animation**: Test smooth 60fps animation during state transitions
- **Color Transitions**: Verify smooth color interpolation between states
- **Disabled State Visual**: Confirm clear visual indication when toggles are disabled
- **Loading States**: Test visual feedback during dependency validation

## Testing Framework

### Individual Toggle Tests
- Single extension enable/disable workflow and state updates
- Command toggle dependency validation with parent extensions
- Toggle animation smoothness and visual feedback accuracy
- Error handling for restricted or invalid toggle attempts

### Dependency Management Tests
- Parent extension disabling cascade to child commands
- Required dependency validation before enabling commands
- Conflict detection between mutually exclusive extensions
- Confirmation dialogs for potentially disruptive changes

### Bulk Operations Tests
- Multi-selection bulk enable/disable functionality
- Bulk operation progress tracking and completion reporting
- Error handling for partially successful bulk operations
- Performance testing with large numbers of selected items

### State Persistence Tests
- Toggle state saving and restoration across sessions
- State synchronization across multiple interface components
- Change history tracking and audit trail completeness
- Database consistency for enable/disable state

### Animation Performance Tests
- Toggle animation frame rate and smoothness validation
- Resource usage during multiple simultaneous toggle animations
- Animation performance under system load conditions
- Memory cleanup after animation completion

## Success Metrics
- All toggle switches function correctly with smooth iOS-style animations
- Dependency system prevents invalid states and provides clear feedback
- Bulk operations complete efficiently with appropriate progress feedback
- Toggle states persist reliably across application sessions
- System performance remains smooth during intensive toggle operations
