# Actions_Items_Config_Menu Task 9: QA Alias Management System

## QA Test Plan

### Alias Validation Tests
- Test validation rule enforcement accuracy
- Verify conflict detection correctness
- Test reserved word filtering
- Validate length constraints

### Alias Resolution Tests
- Test alias-to-command mapping accuracy
- Verify case sensitivity handling
- Test partial matching behavior
- Validate resolution performance

### Suggestion System Tests
- Test suggestion algorithm accuracy
- Verify suggestion relevance scoring
- Test user preference application
- Validate learning system effectiveness

### Conflict Resolution Tests
- Test conflict detection completeness
- Verify resolution option accuracy
- Test user choice persistence
- Validate conflict prevention

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation alias resolution
- Test validation speed with large datasets
- Validate suggestion generation efficiency
- Check memory usage patterns

### Edge Cases
- Empty alias inputs
- Special character handling
- Very long alias names
- Unicode character support

## Success Criteria
- All alias operations accurate and reliable
- Validation comprehensive and fast
- Zero allocations during resolution
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
