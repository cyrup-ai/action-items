# Actions_Items_Config_Menu Task 11: QA Bulk Operations System

## QA Test Plan

### Selection System Tests
- Test multi-selection accuracy across different item types
- Verify selection area handling with mouse interactions
- Test keyboard-based range selection
- Validate selection state persistence

### Bulk Operation Tests
- Test batch enable/disable operations on extensions
- Verify bulk hotkey assignment accuracy
- Test bulk configuration export/import
- Validate batch operation rollback functionality

### Progress Tracking Tests
- Test real-time progress update accuracy
- Verify operation completion notifications
- Test error handling during batch operations
- Validate progress persistence across sessions

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation selection operations
- Test batch processing efficiency with large datasets
- Validate memory usage during long-running operations
- Check UI responsiveness during bulk operations

### Rollback System Tests
- Test rollback operation accuracy
- Verify checkpoint creation and restoration
- Test partial rollback scenarios
- Validate rollback data integrity

### Edge Cases
- Empty selection scenarios
- Network failures during batch operations
- System resource exhaustion
- Concurrent bulk operation conflicts

## Success Criteria
- All bulk operations reliable and efficient
- Selection system accurate and responsive
- Zero allocations during selection management
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
