# Actions_Items_Config_Menu Task 7: QA Hotkey Assignment System

## QA Test Plan

### Hotkey Recording Tests
- Test interactive hotkey capture accuracy
- Verify modifier key detection
- Test recording state transitions
- Validate display string generation

### Conflict Detection Tests
- Test exact hotkey match detection
- Verify partial conflict identification
- Test system hotkey conflict detection
- Validate global hotkey conflicts

### Assignment Management Tests
- Test hotkey-to-command mapping accuracy
- Verify assignment persistence
- Test hotkey removal functionality
- Validate assignment history tracking

### Global Hotkey Tests
- Test system-wide hotkey registration
- Verify cross-platform compatibility
- Test hotkey activation reliability
- Validate unregistration on cleanup

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation event processing
- Test hotkey lookup efficiency
- Validate conflict detection speed
- Check memory usage patterns

### Edge Cases
- Invalid key combinations
- System-reserved hotkeys
- Rapid hotkey reassignment
- Hardware key variations

## Success Criteria
- All hotkey operations reliable and accurate
- Conflict detection comprehensive and fast
- Zero allocations during event processing
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
