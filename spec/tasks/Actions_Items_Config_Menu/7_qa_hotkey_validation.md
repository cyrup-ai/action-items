# Task 7: QA Hotkey Recording and Management System Validation

## Objective
Validate the hotkey recording system including recording interface functionality, global hotkey registration, conflict detection and resolution, and visual hotkey display accuracy.

## Validation Criteria

### Hotkey Recording Interface
- **Record Button**: Verify "Record Hotkey" button triggers recording mode correctly
- **Recording State**: Test recording state shows appropriate visual feedback (red background)
- **Input Capture**: Confirm keyboard input capture works for all supported key combinations
- **Recording Timeout**: Validate recording automatically stops after timeout period

### Hotkey Combination Validation
- **Modifier Requirements**: Verify hotkeys require at least one modifier key (Ctrl, Cmd, Alt)
- **Valid Combinations**: Test various valid hotkey combinations record correctly
- **Invalid Combinations**: Confirm invalid combinations (modifier-only) are rejected
- **Platform Compatibility**: Validate hotkey combinations work across platforms

### Global Registry Management
- **Assignment Tracking**: Verify global registry tracks all hotkey assignments correctly
- **Reverse Lookup**: Test reverse lookup from hotkey to assigned item functions
- **Assignment Updates**: Confirm registry updates when hotkeys are reassigned
- **System Reserved**: Validate system reserved hotkeys are protected from assignment

### Conflict Detection System
- **Conflict Identification**: Test system correctly identifies hotkey conflicts
- **Conflict Modal**: Verify conflict resolution modal appears when conflicts detected
- **Resolution Options**: Confirm all resolution options (replace, cancel) function correctly
- **Resolution Application**: Test conflict resolution applies changes correctly

### Visual Hotkey Display
- **Display Formatting**: Verify hotkey combinations display with proper formatting
- **Platform Symbols**: Test platform-specific symbols (⌘, ⌃, ⌥ on macOS) display correctly
- **Table Display**: Confirm hotkeys display properly in table cells
- **Detail Panel**: Validate hotkey display in detail panel configuration

## Testing Framework

### Recording Workflow Tests
- Complete hotkey recording workflow from button click to assignment
- Recording cancellation and timeout handling
- Invalid combination rejection and user feedback
- Recording state visual feedback and transitions

### Registry Integration Tests
- Global hotkey assignment and tracking accuracy
- Conflict detection with existing assignments
- System reserved hotkey protection
- Registry state persistence across sessions

### Conflict Resolution Tests
- Conflict detection accuracy and modal presentation
- Resolution option functionality and application
- Multiple conflict scenario handling
- Conflict resolution state management

### Platform Compatibility Tests
- Hotkey recording on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Platform-specific modifier key handling
- Visual symbol display accuracy per platform
- Cross-platform hotkey assignment consistency

### Visual Display Tests
- Hotkey formatting accuracy in different contexts
- Font and styling consistency across components
- Symbol rendering for special keys and modifiers
- Display responsiveness at different UI scales

## Success Metrics
- All hotkey recording functionality works correctly with proper validation
- Global registry manages assignments accurately without conflicts
- Conflict detection and resolution provides clear user workflow
- Visual hotkey display is consistent and accurate across all platforms
- System remains responsive during hotkey recording and management operations
