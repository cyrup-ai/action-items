# Actions_Items_Config_Menu Task 5: QA Universal Search System

## QA Test Plan

### Search Algorithm Tests
- Test fuzzy matching accuracy with various inputs
- Verify ranking algorithm correctness
- Test multi-field search functionality
- Validate search threshold effectiveness

### Search Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation search execution
- Test search speed with large datasets
- Validate index building efficiency
- Check debouncing effectiveness

### Filtering System Tests
- Test filter combination accuracy
- Verify filter state management
- Test real-time filter application
- Validate filter persistence

### Search Index Tests
- Test index building correctness
- Verify incremental index updates
- Test index corruption recovery
- Validate memory usage efficiency

### User Interface Tests
- Test search input responsiveness
- Verify result highlighting accuracy
- Test search result navigation
- Validate empty state handling

### Edge Cases
- Empty search queries
- Special characters in search
- Very long search queries
- Rapid search input changes

## Success Criteria
- Search accurate and fast across all scenarios
- Filtering system reliable and responsive
- Zero allocations during search operations
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
