# Advanced_Menu_4 Task 11: QA Certificate Management System

## QA Test Plan

### Certificate Store Tests
- Test certificate installation accuracy
- Verify certificate enumeration
- Test certificate deletion
- Validate store location handling

### Validation Engine Tests
- Test certificate chain validation
- Verify signature validation
- Test validity period checking
- Validate key usage verification

### Revocation Checking Tests
- Test CRL downloading and parsing
- Verify OCSP response handling
- Test revocation status caching
- Validate fallback mechanisms

### Trust Management Tests
- Test trust policy evaluation
- Verify trust decision accuracy
- Test user override handling
- Validate trust level assignment

### Platform Integration Tests
- Test Windows Certificate Store integration
- Verify macOS Keychain integration
- Test Linux certificate store support
- Validate PKCS#11 smart card support

### Security Tests
- Test certificate tampering detection
- Verify private key protection
- Test secure storage mechanisms
- Validate cryptographic operations

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation certificate lookup
- Test chain building efficiency
- Validate revocation checking performance
- Check memory usage patterns

### Edge Cases
- Expired certificates
- Revoked certificates
- Malformed certificate data
- Network failures during validation

## Success Criteria
- All certificate management features work correctly
- Validation and revocation checking reliable
- Zero allocations during certificate operations
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
