# Actions Menu - QA Validation for Contextual Action Menu

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on the contextual action menu implementation and verify compliance with security requirements and smooth animation performance.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Action Menu Architecture Validation
- [ ] Verify `ContextualActionMenu` component implementation with proper state management
- [ ] Check context-sensitive action availability logic correctness
- [ ] Validate smooth slide-in animation performance and timing
- [ ] Confirm keyboard navigation responsiveness with directional keys
- [ ] Test action menu positioning accuracy relative to selected items

#### Standard Actions Implementation
- [ ] Verify "Open Command" primary action with Enter key functionality
- [ ] Check "Reset Ranking" implementation for usage-based ranking system
- [ ] Validate "Move Down in Favorites" with keyboard shortcut (⌃⌘↓)
- [ ] Confirm "Remove from Favorites" with keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘F)
- [ ] Test action execution safety and error handling

#### Security and Safety Validation
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in action menu code
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in src/* action code
- [ ] Check action permission validation before execution
- [ ] Validate safe command parameter handling
- [ ] Confirm prevention of dangerous system-level action execution

#### Dynamic Action System Testing
- [ ] Verify dynamic action availability based on command capabilities
- [ ] Check context-aware action filtering for different command types
- [ ] Validate plugin-extensible action system security
- [ ] Confirm action validation and permission checking robustness
- [ ] Test action discovery performance with large command sets

#### Animation and Visual Quality
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation action menu rendering
- [ ] Check smooth animations using Bevy's animation system
- [ ] Validate visual feedback for action execution status
- [ ] Confirm keyboard shortcut display accuracy
- [ ] Test action hierarchy visual presentation

#### Integration Points Validation
- [ ] Verify command execution system integration for action processing
- [ ] Check favorites management system integration for ranking operations
- [ ] Validate animation system integration for smooth menu transitions
- [ ] Confirm keyboard input system integration for navigation shortcuts
- [ ] Test user confirmation system for destructive operations

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass with emphasis on security validation and smooth animation performance. Any permission vulnerabilities require immediate remediation.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
