# Advanced_Menu_2 Task 9: QA Window Capture System

## QA Test Plan

### Capture Functionality Tests
- Test all capture modes accuracy (fullscreen, window, area)
- Verify window selection functionality
- Test timed capture behavior
- Validate scrolling capture effectiveness

### Image Processing Tests
- Test image format conversion accuracy
- Verify compression quality settings
- Test image metadata preservation
- Validate output file integrity

### Annotation System Tests
- Test all annotation tools functionality
- Verify annotation positioning accuracy
- Test annotation persistence
- Validate annotation export quality

### Sharing Integration Tests
- Test clipboard sharing functionality
- Verify cloud service integration
- Test email attachment creation
- Validate custom endpoint uploads

### Cross-Platform Tests
- Test capture functionality on macOS/Windows/Linux
- Verify platform-specific API integration
- Test permission handling variations
- Validate screen coordinate systems

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation capture initiation
- Test large image processing efficiency
- Validate memory usage during capture
- Check capture operation speed

### Edge Cases
- Multi-monitor capture scenarios
- High DPI display handling
- Permission denied scenarios
- Network failure during sharing

## Success Criteria
- All capture modes work correctly across platforms
- Image quality and processing reliable
- Zero allocations during capture coordination
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
