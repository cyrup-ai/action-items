# Advanced_Menu Task 11: QA Escape Key Behavior

## QA Test Plan

### Escape Mode Tests
- Test all escape mode behaviors (HideLauncher, ClearSearch, etc.)
- Verify mode switching functionality
- Test custom action configuration
- Validate context-sensitive behavior

### Context Detection Tests
- Test context detection accuracy across different app states
- Verify context-specific escape actions
- Test context transition handling
- Validate behavior stack management

### Sequence Detection Tests
- Test escape sequence detection accuracy
- Verify multi-key sequence handling
- Test sequence timeout behavior
- Validate sequence cancellation

### Performance Tests
- Verify zero-allocation key processing
- Test context detection efficiency
- Validate escape action execution speed
- Check memory usage patterns

### Integration Tests
- Test escape behavior with other key bindings
- Verify interaction with modal dialogs
- Test behavior during search operations
- Validate integration with navigation systems

### Edge Cases
- Rapid escape key presses
- Escape during system modal dialogs
- Context changes during escape processing
- Invalid context scenarios

## Success Criteria
- All escape behaviors work correctly
- Context detection accurate and fast
- Zero allocations during key processing
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code
- Complete test coverage (>95%)
