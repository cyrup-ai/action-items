# Task 3: QA Display and Multi-Monitor Management Validation

## Objective
Validate the display and multi-monitor management system including monitor detection, dropdown functionality, window positioning accuracy, and hot-plug monitor handling.

## Validation Criteria

### Multi-Monitor Detection System
- **Monitor Discovery**: Verify accurate detection of all connected monitors across platforms
- **Monitor Information**: Test correct gathering of resolution, scale factor, position, and refresh rate
- **Primary Monitor**: Confirm accurate identification of primary display
- **Work Area Calculation**: Validate proper work area detection excluding taskbars/dock areas

### Display Settings Dropdown
- **Option Generation**: Verify dropdown populates with all available screen selection options
- **Current Selection**: Test dropdown displays current screen selection accurately
- **Option Selection**: Confirm clicking dropdown options updates display settings
- **Dynamic Updates**: Test dropdown options update when monitors are connected/disconnected

### Window Positioning Logic
- **Mouse Screen**: Verify launcher appears on screen containing mouse cursor
- **Primary Screen**: Test launcher positioning on primary monitor
- **Focused Window Screen**: Confirm launcher appears on screen with focused window
- **Specific Screen**: Validate launcher positioning on user-selected specific monitor

### Hot-Plug Monitor Support
- **Connection Detection**: Test automatic detection when new monitors are connected
- **Disconnection Handling**: Verify graceful handling when monitors are disconnected
- **Setting Adaptation**: Confirm settings adapt when selected monitor becomes unavailable
- **User Notification**: Test appropriate notifications for monitor configuration changes

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **macOS Support**: Validate Core Graphics integration for monitor detection
- **Windows Support**: Test Windows display API integration
- **Linux Support**: Confirm X11/Wayland display system compatibility
- **Platform-Specific Features**: Verify platform-specific display features work correctly

## Testing Framework

### Monitor Detection Tests
- Multi-monitor setup detection accuracy across different configurations
- Monitor information gathering completeness and accuracy
- Primary monitor identification across different system configurations
- Work area calculation accuracy with various taskbar/dock configurations

### Window Positioning Tests
- Launcher positioning accuracy on each screen selection option
- Center positioning calculation with different monitor sizes and scales
- Edge case handling for monitors with unusual resolutions or positions
- Multi-monitor boundary handling and window clipping prevention

### Hot-Plug Integration Tests
- Monitor connection detection timing and accuracy
- Dropdown option updates during monitor configuration changes
- Window repositioning when target monitor becomes unavailable
- User notification system during display configuration changes

### Settings Integration Tests
- Screen selection persistence across application sessions
- Settings synchronization with dropdown display
- Real-time updates when display configuration changes
- Error handling for invalid screen selection settings

### Performance Tests
- Monitor detection performance with large numbers of displays
- Window positioning calculation efficiency
- Hot-plug detection responsiveness and system resource usage
- Memory management during frequent monitor configuration changes

## Success Metrics
- All connected monitors are detected accurately with correct specifications
- Window positioning works reliably across all screen selection options
- Hot-plug monitor support handles connection/disconnection seamlessly
- Cross-platform compatibility maintains consistent functionality
- System performance remains acceptable during display configuration changes
