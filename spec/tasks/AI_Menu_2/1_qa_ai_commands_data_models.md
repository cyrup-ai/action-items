# AI Menu 2 - QA Validation for AI Commands Data Models

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on AI Commands data models and verify compliance with all constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in AI commands systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in AI commands systems
- [ ] Confirm proper error handling for template parsing and validation
- [ ] Validate zero-allocation template processing where possible
- [ ] Check blazing-fast performance for command configuration

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/ai/commands/config.rs` implements AICommandsConfig (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/ai/commands/templates.rs` implements template system (lines 1-134)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/ai/commands/custom_command.rs` implements command structure (lines 1-78)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/ai/commands/provider_integration.rs` implements provider layer (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/ai/commands/template_parser.rs` implements parser (lines 1-56)

#### Bevy Integration Compliance
- [ ] Verify reflection/reflection.rs patterns correctly implemented for configuration
- [ ] Confirm ecs/system_param.rs patterns used for resource management
- [ ] Check asset/asset_loading.rs patterns implemented for template loading
- [ ] Validate ecs/event.rs patterns used for AI command events

#### AI Commands Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test default model selection works with Gemini 2.5 Pro integration
- [ ] Verify custom instruction storage and retrieval functions correctly
- [ ] Confirm per-command model override capability works
- [ ] Test template hot-reloading during development workflow
- [ ] Validate provider icon loading and display integration

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test integration with ui/src/settings/ai_config/ base configuration
- [ ] Verify integration with core/src/runtime/ for command execution (lines 89-167)
- [ ] Confirm integration with ui/src/ai/provider_bridge.rs communication
- [ ] Test integration with app/src/preferences/ for persistence

#### Template System Testing
- [ ] Test structured template format with variable substitution
- [ ] Verify input validation and sanitization for command parameters
- [ ] Confirm template versioning and migration support
- [ ] Test custom command sharing and import/export functionality

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Verify template processing doesn't impact AI response time
- [ ] Test configuration loading completes within acceptable timeframes
- [ ] Confirm provider detection doesn't block UI responsiveness
- [ ] Validate memory usage stable during template operations

### Acceptance Criteria
All checklist items must pass before proceeding to tools configuration implementation.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
