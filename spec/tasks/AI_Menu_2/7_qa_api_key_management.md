# AI Menu 2 - QA Validation for Custom API Key Management

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on API key management system and verify compliance with all security constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Security Verification (Critical)
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in API key systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in API key systems
- [ ] Confirm API keys encrypted at rest using system keychain
- [ ] Validate API keys never logged or exposed in debug output
- [ ] Check secure transmission with TLS encryption for all provider communications

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/ai/api_keys/storage.rs` implements secure storage (lines 1-123)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/ai/api_keys/routing.rs` implements routing system (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/ai/api_keys/usage_tracking.rs` implements tracking (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Verify `ui/src/ai/api_keys/security.rs` implements security layer (lines 1-78)

#### API Key Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test secure storage integration with system keychain (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- [ ] Verify provider-specific key validation (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- [ ] Confirm routing rules: Anthropic/Google/OpenAI via Raycast servers
- [ ] Test OpenRouter direct provider routing functionality
- [ ] Validate cost tracking and usage analytics per provider

#### Security Testing (Critical)
- [ ] Test API key validation without key exposure
- [ ] Verify audit logging captures all key operations
- [ ] Confirm key access requires proper authentication
- [ ] Test automatic key rotation support where available
- [ ] Validate encrypted transmission for all API communications

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test integration with system keychain APIs (Keychain Services, Credential Store, Secret Service)
- [ ] Verify integration with ui/src/ai/provider_bridge.rs routing
- [ ] Confirm integration with app/src/preferences/ management
- [ ] Test cost tracking integration with billing systems

#### Provider Routing Testing
- [ ] Test intelligent request routing based on provider capabilities
- [ ] Verify cost optimization through proper routing
- [ ] Confirm fallback handling when providers unavailable
- [ ] Test usage tracking accuracy for billing purposes

### Acceptance Criteria
ALL security requirements must pass with zero tolerance for key exposure risks before completion.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.
