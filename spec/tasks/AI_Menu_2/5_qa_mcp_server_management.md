# AI Menu 2 - QA Validation for MCP Server Management

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on MCP server management and verify compliance with all constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### MCP Protocol Compliance
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in MCP systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in MCP systems
- [ ] Confirm MCP protocol specification compliance
- [ ] Validate server discovery and connection handling
- [ ] Check automatic tool confirmation security warnings

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/ai/mcp/server_manager.rs` implements management interface (lines 1-134)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/ai/mcp/idle_management.rs` implements timeout system (lines 1-67)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/ai/mcp/auto_confirmation.rs` implements confirmation system (lines 1-78)

#### MCP Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test "Manage Servers" button opens server configuration interface
- [ ] Verify server idle timeout configuration (5 minutes default)
- [ ] Confirm automatic tool confirmation displays security warning
- [ ] Test server health monitoring and connection recovery
- [ ] Validate integration with experimental HTTP servers

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test integration with ui/src/ai/tools/permissions.rs
- [ ] Verify integration with core/src/runtime/ for communication
- [ ] Confirm integration with app/src/preferences/ for persistence

#### Security and Performance Testing
- [ ] Test security implications clearly communicated for auto-confirmation
- [ ] Verify resource-efficient connection pooling
- [ ] Confirm audit logging for all MCP operations
- [ ] Test server cleanup prevents resource leaks

### Acceptance Criteria
All MCP protocol compliance and security requirements must pass before proceeding to API key management.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.
