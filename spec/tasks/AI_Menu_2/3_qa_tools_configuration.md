# AI Menu 2 - QA Validation for Tools Configuration System

## Task: Act as an Objective QA Rust Developer

Rate the work performed previously on tools configuration system and verify compliance with all constraints.

### QA Validation Checklist

#### Security and Permission Verification
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `unwrap()` in tools systems
- [ ] Verify NO usage of `expect()` in tools systems
- [ ] Confirm explicit user consent required for all tool executions
- [ ] Validate security warnings for automatic confirmation settings
- [ ] Check audit logging for all tool permissions and executions

#### File Implementation Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ui/src/ai/tools/permissions.rs` implements permission system (lines 1-123)
- [ ] Validate `ui/src/ai/tools/tool_call_info.rs` implements info display (lines 1-89)
- [ ] Check `ui/src/ai/tools/mcp_integration.rs` implements MCP foundation (lines 1-67)

#### Tools Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test "Show Tool Call Info" checkbox toggles debugging visibility correctly
- [ ] Verify "Reset Tool Confirmations" button clears all permissions
- [ ] Confirm tool permission requests show clear security information
- [ ] Test "Automatically confirm all tool calls" displays security warning
- [ ] Validate MCP server idle timeout configuration (5 minutes)

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test integration with ui/src/ai/provider_bridge.rs for tool execution
- [ ] Verify integration with app/src/preferences/ for permission persistence
- [ ] Confirm integration with core/src/runtime/ for sandboxed execution

#### Security Testing
- [ ] Test permission system prevents unauthorized tool access
- [ ] Verify tool execution occurs in sandboxed environment
- [ ] Confirm audit logging captures all tool activities
- [ ] Test security warnings appear for risky automation settings

### Acceptance Criteria
All security and permission requirements must pass before proceeding to MCP server management.

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.
