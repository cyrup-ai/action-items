# Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book

[Print this book](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/print.html "Print this book")[Suggest an edit](https://github.com/bevy-cheatbook/bevy-cheatbook/issues/new "Suggest an edit")

This is a reference-style book for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/)
( [GitHub](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)).

It aims to teach Bevy concepts in a concise way, help you be productive,
and discover the knowledge you need.

This book aggregates a lot of community wisdom that is often not covered
by official documentation, saving you the need to struggle with issues that
others have figured out already!

While it aims to be exhaustive, documenting an entire game engine is
a monumental task. I focus my time on whatever I believe the community
needs most.

Therefore, there are still a lot of omissions, both for basics and advanced
topics. Nevertheless, I am confident this book will prove to be a valuable
resource to you!

_**Welcome! May this book serve you well!**_

The pages in this book are not designed to be read in order. Each page covers
a standalone topic. Feel free to jump to whatever interests you.

If you have a specific topic in mind that you would like to learn about, you
can find it from the table-of-contents (sidebar) or using the search function
(in the top bar).

The [Chapter Overview](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/overview.html) page will give you a general idea
of how the book is structured.

The text on each page will link to other pages, where you can learn about other
things mentioned in the text. This helps you jump around the book.

If you are new to Bevy, or would like a more guided experience, try the
[Guided Tour tutorial](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/tutorial/guide.html). It will help you navigate the book in
an order that makes sense for learning, from beginner to advanced topics.

The [Bevy Builtins](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/builtins.html) page is a concise cheatsheet of useful
information about types and features provided by Bevy.

Bevy has a rich collection of [official code examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#examples).

Check out [bevy-assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets), for community-made resources.

Our community is very friendly and helpful. Feel welcome to join the [Bevy\\

Bevy has a very rapid pace of development, with new major releases around
3 times a year. Every version brings a lot of changes, so keeping this book
updated can be a major challenge.

To ease the maintenance burden, the policy of the project is that the book may
contain content for different versions of Bevy. However, mixing Bevy versions
on the same page is not allowed.

At the top of every page, you will see the version it was last updated for.
All content on that page must be relevant for the stated Bevy version.

Bevy is still a new and experimental game engine! It has only been public
since August 2020!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development
is active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

_There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!_

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases, but you have been
warned!
